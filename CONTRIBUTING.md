# Contributing
We appreciate your contributions to Terbium! Please ensure that you meet the following requirements before
contributing any code to Terbium, however:

- Have experience in both Rust and Terbium
- Run both `cargo check` and `cargo fmt` if you have modified Rust code
  - (`cargo check` will handle this) Make sure each line is under 120 characters long
  - We also advise you to run `cargo test` as well, but that will be tested by the GitHub workflow check.
    Doing such will probably save you an unnecessary commit if the check does fail.
